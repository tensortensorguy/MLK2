# MLK+ Polyhedral Optimizer Specification

**Component**: `mlk_poly` (`polyhedral/`) + the `poly.*` pass family
**Status**: implemented, 37 unit tests + differential runtime validation

The polyhedral optimizer brings loop-nest transformation to MLK+ kernel
compilation: SCoP extraction, exact data-dependence analysis, affine
scheduling, tiling, and Kernel IR regeneration — all over a hermetic
Presburger engine with no external dependencies (Rule 160).

## Pipeline placement

```
lower.to_kernel_ir          (baseline 1-D loops + GEMM Call)
    |
poly.synth                  multi-dim affine nests for the synth classes
    |
poly.scop_detect            SCoP extraction (statements, domains, accesses)
    |
poly.dependence             exact RAW / WAR / WAW relations
    |
poly.schedule               LP-selected rows: parallel-first fusion search,
                            distance-minimal sequential rows, identity
                            fallback (see §scheduling)
    |
poly.tile                   tileable band detection + tile sizes
    |
poly.codegen                schedule -> new Kernel IR loop forest
    |
poly.verify                 legality re-proof; baseline restore on failure
    |
backend.emit_binary
```

Tier 1 never runs poly passes (baseline kernel compiler). Tier 2/3 run the
full chain; every pass has a kill switch (Rule 60) and every failure keeps
the baseline kernel (Rules 62/102/115).

## The engine (`polyhedral/include/mlk/poly/`)

| Module | Contents |
|---|---|
| `rational.h` | Exact rationals (int64/int64, normalized; checked int64 ops in `checked.h`; magnitude limit 2^30 keeps cross-products inside int64 — `-Wpedantic` forbids `__int128`) |
| `affine_expr.h` | Integer affine expressions over `{dims, symbols}` spaces |
| `int_set.h` | Disjunctive Presburger sets: intersection/union/complement/subtract, Fourier–Motzkin elimination with tri-state `Feasibility` (Empty / NonEmpty / Unknown — Rule 22 discipline), exact lexMin/lexMax via lexicographic branch-and-bound with witness verification |
| `affine_map.h` | Affine maps: composition, image/preimage via product-space projection |
| `scop.h` | SCoP model (statements, full-rank domains, flat access maps) + extraction from `KernelModule` |
| `dependence.h` | Dependence relations over the product space (src dims \| dst dims) |
| `lp.h` | Exact rational simplex (Bland's rule — deterministic and cycling-free, Rule 53; phase-1 artificials with post-phase-1 basis cleanup) |
| `pluto.h` | Affine scheduling + `verifyScheduleLegality` |
| `tile.h` | Tileable band detection |
| `codegen.h` | Schedule → Kernel IR emission |
| `workspace.h` | Per-compilation `PolyWorkspace` threaded through `PassContext` (Rule 144: explicit state, no hidden globals) |

### Soundness contract

- Fourier–Motzkin gives **rational** emptiness; rational emptiness implies
  integer emptiness (safe direction). Rational non-emptiness is refined by
  witness-verified integer points wherever a point is required (lexmin).
- `Feasibility::Unknown` (budget exhaustion) is treated as **NonEmpty** by
  every legality caller: optimization may be lost, correctness never.
- Equality substitution consumes the equality rationally; integer gaps are
  covered by the same conservative direction.
- Dependence relations are purified with the original program order
  (intra-statement: sink >lex source with distinct instances;
  cross-statement: sink >=lex source with statement-order tie-break).
- Accumulate stores carry an implicit read access — the accumulator chain
  is the reduction-order legality gate (Rules 33/90: reassociation only
  with a contract).

## SCoP model

- One kernel = one SCoP: the whole node forest must be affine
  (Loop/Compute/Store only); mixed kernels stay on the baseline path.
- Statements are Compute+Store pairs (the kernel statement convention,
  docs/kernel_abi.md).
- Domains are full-rank boxes over the scoping depth; statements at
  shallower depth pin deeper dims to 0 (init-then-accumulate semantics).
- Accesses are flat row-major affine index maps (dense buffers); legacy
  ElemA/ElemB/Store forms synthesize innermost-loop coefficients.
- Eligibility: unit steps, constant bounds within the magnitude limit,
  statement/access/depth budgets from `core/constants.h` (Rule 10).

## Scheduling

Every row is SELECTED by an LP over the schedule coefficients — nothing is
copied from the original loop order. Per row, each live dependence d
contributes its SLICE (relation refined by all earlier rows' `dist == 0`
equalities); Farkas' lemma turns "dist_r(v) >= 0 for all v in slice" into
linear constraints over the coefficients. Three deterministic stages,
first feasible wins:

1. **Parallel search** — a feasibility LP with BOTH `dist >= 0` and
   `-dist >= 0` blocks per live dependence: a row under which every live
   dependence distance is identically zero. Such rows FUSE statement
   nests and carry nothing (producer/consumer elementwise chains collapse
   into one loop; see `pluto_fusion_emergence`).
2. **Sequential search** — minimize `sum_d M_d` (distance epigraphs)
   subject to validity and `sum_d M_d >= 1` (progress): distance-minimal
   carrying rows, the fusion/skewing driver. Stencil time rows fall out
   here, with the space row parallel (`pluto_sor_time_space_parallel`).
3. **Identity fallback** — `theta = e_pivot`. Original-order purification
   orients every dependence forward, so this row is always valid; it
   guarantees termination even when both LP searches reject.

Shape contract (checked per realized row, codegen compatibility): every
statement is either a foldable constant (nonzero coefficients only on
pinned dims) or varies on the row's PIVOT dim with a positive coefficient.
Spent-dim (outer-loop) coefficients stay free in the LP — skew terms —
and never reach loop bounds: with the loop variable kept as the pivot dim
and box bounds, the nest enumerates instances in exactly the schedule's
lexicographic order. Rows are emitted until every varying dim is spent
(TOTALITY: each instance maps to a distinct schedule vector, so codegen
replays each payload exactly once — this also fixes the instance collapse
zero-row schedules used to inflict on no-dependence kernels).
Dependences still live at that point are schedule-tied and resolve by
statement order (`origOrder`); `verifyScheduleLegality` proves exactly
that tie-break rule. Candidate LPs that trip size budgets reject the
candidate (Rule 10) rather than failing the schedule.

Parallel marking: a row is parallel iff every live dependence distance is
identically zero on its refined slice (a row that *carries* a dependence —
strictly positive distance — is sequential). The innermost parallel row is
the vectorizable one. `verifyScheduleLegality` re-proves the final
schedule lexicographically; `poly.verify` runs it before the backend.

Known quality limitation: the pivot enumeration is ascending by dim index
(identity pivot order is always feasible, so it always wins) — loop
PERMUTATION orders and skew-driven reorders are therefore not synthesized
yet; schedules are legal, deterministic, fusion-capable and
parallelism-preferring, but not always locality-optimal. The autotuner
gates adoption by measurement (Rule 32); free-coefficient rows plus
CLAST-style codegen (if/while/guards) are the roadmap items.

## Codegen

Emission walks schedule levels over the statement group:

- **Separator levels** (all-constant rows) emit statements in
  (time, origOrder) order.
- **Loop levels** emit one shared loop over the row's PIVOT dim
  (fusion; skew coefficients on spent dims are order-only and invisible
  in bounds). Statements whose row is pin-foldable (all nonzero
  coefficients on dims pinned for that statement — the init statement's
  `k == 0`) hoist as constant items: values below the loop range emit
  before, above after, at the range start only when the remaining rows
  are constants dominated by the varying statements' minimums
  (`canEmitBefore`, conservative box check). Pin-folding also applies to
  payload re-indexing: coefficients on pinned dims fold into the ElemIdx
  / store offset.
- **Tiled band levels** emit a TILE loop (constant bounds
  `floor(lo/t)`, `floor(hi/t)`) plus a POINT loop with affine bounds
  `t*ti … t*ti + t - 1`; a trailing partial tile (when `(hi+1) % t != 0`)
  carries a constant clipped end. Inner-tree duplication per split is
  bounded by `kPolyMaxCodegenCopies`.
- Payloads replay the statement Compute chain and Store (accumulate
  preserved) with ElemIdx operands re-indexed from scop-dim to
  stack-position coefficients; store targets map the same way.

Kernel IR extensions (all backward compatible, hashed and serialized per
Rule 24): `KernelOperand::Kind::ElemIdx` (buffer + per-stack-position
coefficients + offset), affine loop bounds (`beginCoeffs/endCoeffs` over
the enclosing var stack), buffer-dim loop bounds (`endBuf/endDim`), and
`Store::accumulate`.

Bail conditions (conservative, baseline preserved): statements neither
pin-foldable nor pivot-varying (scheduler shape contract violation),
unaligned tile lower bounds, copy-budget exhaustion, unbounded levels,
accesses referencing unpinned unspent dims.

## Executor

`executeKernelOnBuffers` routes any module containing multi-dim features
through a recursive tree walker (loop-var stack, affine bounds, ElemIdx
resolution, accumulate stores); the legacy 1-D fast path keeps its
chunked threading. Multi-dim execution is single-threaded in v1 (Rule 12
roadmap).

## Verification story

- Unit: 40 tests in `tests/unit/unit_poly.cpp` covering the engine
  (rationals, sets, FM, lexmin, maps), extraction, dependences, LP,
  scheduling legality + determinism, FUSION EMERGENCE (producer/consumer
  single parallel row + bit-exact fused execution), wavefront dependences,
  SOR time/space parallel marking, tiling, codegen structure, the full
  pass chain, and differential execution.
- Differential (Rules 43/85/90): the transformed GEMM executes over dense
  buffers and matches a straightforward reference (bit-exact for the
  no-reassociation class; accumulation order per output cell preserved).
- `poly.verify` re-proves legality inside every Tier2/3 compilation and
  restores the baseline on failure.

## Roadmap

- Free-coefficient schedule rows + CLAST-style codegen (unlocks loop
  permutation orders, skew-driven locality reordering, and the full Pluto
  ILP fusion objective; the current shape contract pins loop variables to
  pivot dims with box bounds).
- Parametric SCoPs (symbolic dims with runtime guards) — currently
  requires constant bounds after workload specialization.
- ReduceSum/softmax synthesis classes; >2-input elementwise (needs the
  baseline buffer-materialization limit lifted).
- Multi-threaded multi-dim execution (Rule 12).
- Multiple SCoP regions per kernel.
